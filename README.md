## My process
The process was a very lenghty one. I got stuck on trying to get the little image icons to be on the same line with their little description and to spend a few hours figuring out how to do it and lucky i finaly did though it does not look really good but this is not really bad for a start

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Don't know if what i did is correct buti guess i learned how to put the icon and the text on the same line

### Continued development

CSS as a whole. Still need a lot of work on it so i will continue puttng more work on learning more CSS techniques
